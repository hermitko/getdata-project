# getdata-project
## Repo for solution of the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data coursera class.

The task is to create tidy dataset from the raw one (detailed instruction in coursera class).

All the work is done by the script `run_analysis.R`.

It reads, merges and transforms all data needed and summarizes it to get desired tidy dataset.

It should be placed in the main folder of the unzipped data file (folder `UCI HAR Dataset`).

It produces the file `tidy_activity_dataset.txt` in same folder, where the final tidy dataset is saved.
